~been received The formal announcement to the Government of the 
~Government to terminate the Treaty of the 5th April 1831, between 
~States and Texas, in all matters relating to Commerce and Naviga- 
~here. It will therefore be of vast importance to us to know dis- 
~ing and what will probably go without question. There seems to be 
~Navigation of the border rivers, The Sabine and Red Rivers to the 
~great and growing imj&gt;ortance to a very large and wealthy portion 
~of our citizens, it should no longer be permitted to remain in doubt. 
~United States, who had occasion to touch upon this subject, was 
~their "natural right to the free Navigation of the Mississippi to its 
~entrance in to the sea." ^ The Congress too on several occasions, 
~United States, and that the same ought to be considered and sup- 
~actually put to the negotiations with Spain and the whole matter 
~referred to Congress, because of the unwavering pertinacity, with 
~which Spain Clung to her claim of the exclusive right to the use of 
~troversy, is a matter of history to be found in all their public records. 
~United States own to the Western bank below the 31°^ N latitude, 
~right to the free navigation of the Sabine will be questioned, seems a 
~violent one, and the only object to be attained in introducing it into 
~the Treaty is to shut up the door against all future doubt. I have 
~not been able to ascertain whether the right of this country to the 
~complaints from among our own citizens begin to be frequent of 
~right to the free navigation of this River ought never to be abandoned. 
~In regard to our Indian relations, it would be diflBcult it seems to 
~me&gt; to place them upon a fairer or more equitable footing than the 
~United States have tacitly acknowledged to be mutually binding. A 
~little more precision might perhaps be given to certain expressions in 
~it, if there be any reasonable doubt as to their true meaning, a doubt 
~mutual obligations of the two Governments to restrain their Indians 
~property of their neighbors, is to my mind a natural one. It follows 
~that Country, and no nation will be permitted to enquire into, or 
~every government is bound to restrain their Citizens from making 
~war on a friendly power, needs only to be asserted to be universally 
~accorded. The Same reasoning is o^ course equally applicable to 
~war upon the other contracting power, it ought to be the bounden 
~duty of the former, to send such a Military fore© against such Indians, 
~as wiU be sufficient to disarm them, and to capture the principal 
~offenders, who should be given up for punishment to the aggrieved 
~tion on the part of the United States to remove such of their Indians 
~questionable so far as relates to all such Indians as have come into 
~our territory since our separation from Mexico, as well as to those 
~who came here prior to that period without the sanction or permis- 
~principles that it is not thought necessary [to] enumerate them. But 
~that there is another obligation on the part of the United States to 
~anterior to the date of our declaration of Independence, and while

~Indians are meant to be included in the Treaty. The principle once

~seize the earliest favorable opportunity to make a representation 
~upon the subject, to the Mexican Government. On the 2nd. ultimo,

~From the statements made to this Government, the following 
~appear to be the facte of the case. On the 15th. of March, last, an 
~application was made by several American citizens to the Depart-

~ment to have the escort organized for the purpose of protecting such

~the Secretary of War to order forthwith a Court of Inquiry upon

~Whatever backwardness may seem to have been shown, in attend-

~tion would endeavor to produce against the present Ministry. 
~Knowing this to be the dUenmui of the Govmt. I have been disposed 
~to assent to every thing that has been required, and go for my first 
~ihem thus to gvoe ear to your views and wishes. Of course, I would 
~stand me to say they oppose the Texas question, or any part of it, on 
~its merits; hut they stand ready to pounce upon every thing the 
~Govmt do, to render it wnpopuLwr^ and endeavour to bring about a

~claim to the indemnity which might be paid to Mexico for the in-
