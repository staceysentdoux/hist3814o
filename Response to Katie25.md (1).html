<p>I found Katie’s response to sit very well with my opinions. In this very age, where Trump is in power and ‘fake news’ is quite popular amongst the media, it  is important to view the evidence, as well as where the author is drawing their arguments from. It is important not to just blindly accept what you are reading as truths like Katie adds. People rely on media and publications to provide the public with the truths, and having this sense of ‘openness’ helps to reaffirmate the truth as well as create a better sense of trust between publications and the public. Additionally, Katie suggests that this sense of “openness” can help researchers add and expand on their own research by providing new and more sources. This in fact will create a bigger picture for the researcher, and provide way more evidence or perhaps critiques on the topic. I found this to be true, as often times when composing an essay, I tend to find more sources that I am able to utilize, whether they be in the footnotes or the bibliography. This is extremely helpful I find, as it allows the reader or researcher to link various ideas and resources together. I often find it difficult to find a way to make the links between sources flow when I write massive research essays, having the ability to easily locate sources and evidence with that transparency, makes writing this tedious essays much easier.</p>
